# Advanced Decision Making Exercises
# 1.	Create a file named heads_or_tails.py in this folder. Write a program that lets the user guess whether the flip of a coin results in heads or tails. The program randomly generates an integer 0 to 1, which represents heads or tails. The program prompts the user to enter a guess and reports whether the guess is correct or incorrect.
# a.	import the random module to generate a random numbers
# b.	use random.randint(0, 1) to generate a random number between 0 and 1
# import random

# random_number = random.randint(0,1)

# user_guess = input("Guess the coin flip! Enter heads or tails (h/t): ")

# if random_number == 0:
#     print("The coin flip was: heads")
# else:
#     print("The coin flip was: tails")

# #OR use the a ternary condition 
# result = "heads" if random_number == 0 else "tails"
# print(f"The coin flip was: {result}")

# #OR
# print (f"The coin flip was: {"heads" if random_number == 0 else "tails"}")

# if (random_number == 0 and user_guess == "h") or (random_number == 1 and user_guess == "t"):
#     print("You guessed correct!")
# else:
#     print("You guessed wrong!")
 
# 2.	create a file named leap_year.py in this folder. Write a program to determine if a user input year is a leap year. A year is a leap year if it is divisible by 4 but not by 100, or if it is divisible by 400. 
# year = int(input("Enter a year: "))

# if year % 4 == 0 and year % 100 !=0 or year % 400 == 0:
#     print(f"Is {year} a leap year? True")
# else:
#     print(f"Is {year} a leap year? False")

# # 1 print only and no else

# result = "false"
# if year % 4 == 0 and year % 100 !=0 or year % 400 == 0:
#     result = "true"

# print(f"Is {year} a leap year? {result}")

# #no if or else
# print(f"Is {year} a leap year? {(year % 4 == 0 and year % 100 !=0) or year % 400 == 0}")


   
# 3.	Create a file named rock_paper_scissors.py in this folder. Write a program that plays the scissor-rock-paper game. (A scissor cuts paper, a rock can crush a scissor, and a paper can cover a rock.) The program randomly generates a number 0, 1, or 2 representing scissor, rock, and paper. The program prompts the user to enter a number 0, 1, or 2 and displays a message indicating whether the user or the computer wins, loses, or draws. 
# import random

# #Get user input and generate a random number between 0 and 2
# user_input =  int(input("Scissor (0), rock (1), paper (2): "))
# computer_input = random.randint(0, 2)

# #Translate the user input integer to a string word
# if user_input == 0:
#     user_result = "scissor"
# elif user_input == 1:
#     user_result = "rock"
# elif user_input == 2:
#     user_result = "paper"

# #Translate the computer integer to a string word
# #demo match case
# match computer_input:            
#     case 0:
#         computer_result = "scissor"
#     case 1:
#         computer_result = "rock"
#     case 2:
#         computer_result = "paper"   

# result = "You lose"
# #tie
# if user_result == computer_result:
#     result = "It is a draw"
# elif (user_result == "paper" and computer_result == "rock") or (user_result == "rock" and computer_result == "scissor") or (user_result == "scissor" and computer_result == "paper"):
#     result = "You win!"

# print (f"The computer is {computer_result}. You are {user_result}. {result}")

 

# # 4.	Create a file named month_name.py in this folder. Write a program that will take a month number from the user and print the name of the month. If the user enters a number that is out of the range 1 to 12, the program should print an error message. Do this using a match statement. 
# month_number = int(input("Enter a month number (1-12): "))
# print("Month is: ")
# match month_number:
#     case 1: 
#             print("January")
#     case 2:
#             print ("February")
#     case 3:
#             print ("March")
#     case 4:
#             print ("April")
#     case 5:
#             print ("May")
#     case 6:
#             print ("June")
#     case 7:
#             print ("July")
#     case 8:
#             print ("August")
#     case 9:
#             print ("September")
#     case 10:
#             print ("October")
#     case 11:
#             print ("November")
#     case 12:
#             print ("December")    
#     case _:
#             print("Not a valid month!")

   
# 5.	Create file named package_selector.py in this folder. Write a program for a gym so that it can determine which membership package a person should purchase. There are three packages:
# Package A: $40/month, 4 months
# Package B: $55/month, 8 months
# Package C: $75/month, 12 months
# Package D: $100/month, 12 month Note: ensure you have the words "You have selected Package A" or which ever package you select
 
is_valid = True

package = input("Enter the package letter (A/B/C/D): ")
PACKAGE_A_FEE = 40
PACKAGE_A_LENGTH = 4
PACKAGE_B_FEE = 55
PACKAGE_B_LENGTH = 8
PACKAGE_C_FEE = 75
PACKAGE_C_LENGTH = 12
PACKAGE_D_FEE = 100
PACKAGE_D_LENGTH = 12

match package.upper():
    case "A":
        monthly_fee = PACKAGE_A_FEE
        total_fee = monthly_fee * PACKAGE_A_LENGTH
    case "B":
        monthly_fee = PACKAGE_B_FEE
        total_fee = monthly_fee * PACKAGE_B_LENGTH
    case "C":
        monthly_fee = PACKAGE_C_FEE
        total_fee = monthly_fee * PACKAGE_C_LENGTH
    case "D":
        monthly_fee = PACKAGE_D_FEE
        total_fee = monthly_fee * PACKAGE_D_LENGTH
    case _:
        is_valid = False
    

if is_valid : #same as if is_valid == True
    print(f"You have selected package {package}")
    print(f"Your monthly fee is ${monthly_fee:.2f}")
    print(f"Your total fee is ${total_fee:.2f}")
